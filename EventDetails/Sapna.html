        <p><span class="first-character sc">I</span>n order to spread awareness about menstruation, we organized the event Sapna in 2019 at Jagannath Ashram, Sector 6. We had also visited OSAP Battalion in 2018 to organize a menstrual awareness campaign.
          The event was themed as Sapna: Sanitary Pads Awareness. The money collected during the fund raising events (like Housie etc) was used in this.
          A presentation was prepared and the cause of menstrual cycle was made aware. Sanitary napkins were distributed. Our members interacted with the residents and talked about their problems and difficulties. Prof. Upendra Gundala, VP of Literary and Cultural Society, was present throughout the event and made it a huge success.
